                    GUARDX DEFI PROTECTION PLATFORM
                         PROJECT ANALYSIS
================================================================================

PROJECT GOAL
============
GuardX is a smart contract system that automatically protects your cryptocurrency 
investments during market crashes. Think of it as an automatic safety system for 
your crypto portfolio that sells your risky assets and converts them to stable 
coins when prices drop too much.

HOW IT WORKS (SIMPLE EXPLANATION)
==================================

1. YOU DEPOSIT YOUR CRYPTO
   - You put your ETH or other tokens into the GuardX system
   - You set rules like "if my assets drop 20%, protect me"
   - You choose which stablecoin you want (like USDC)

2. THE SYSTEM WATCHES PRICES
   - GuardX constantly monitors cryptocurrency prices using Pyth Network
   - It compares current prices to historical prices
   - It detects when a crash is happening

3. AUTOMATIC PROTECTION KICKS IN
   - When prices drop below your threshold, the system acts automatically
   - It sells your risky assets
   - It converts them to stablecoins to protect your value
   - All of this happens without you needing to do anything

4. CROSS-CHAIN PROTECTION
   - Your assets can be protected across multiple blockchains
   - If you have crypto on Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum, GuardX protects all of them
   - Uses Lit Protocol for secure cross-chain operations


MAIN COMPONENTS
===============

1. CRASHGUARDCORE CONTRACT
   Purpose: Main hub for managing your assets and protection settings
   
   Key Functions:
   - depositAsset(): Put your crypto into the protection system
   - withdrawAsset(): Take your crypto out when you want
   - setProtectionPolicy(): Set your crash protection rules
   - getUserPortfolio(): Check what assets you have protected
   - getUserBalance(): See how much of each token you have
   
   How to Use:
   - First, deposit your assets (ETH or ERC20 tokens)
   - Set your protection policy with crash threshold and max slippage
   - The system now monitors your portfolio automatically
   - Withdraw anytime you want

2. EMERGENCYEXECUTOR CONTRACT
